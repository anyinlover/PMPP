> In this chapter we implemented a matrix multiplication kernel that has each thread produce one output matrix element. In this question, you will implement different matrix-matrix multiplication kernels and compare them.

> a. Write a kernel that has each thread produce one output matrix row. Fill in the execution configuration parameters for the design.

[row execution](./matrixMul_a.cu)

> b. Write a kernel that has each thread produce one output matrix column. Fill in the execution configuration parameters for the design.

[col execution](./matrixMul_b.cu)

> c. Analyze the pros and cons of each of the two kernel designs.

Row-based kernel can be optimized for row-major memory access pattern, and have better parallelism if the number of rows is larger than the number of columns. Column-based kernel can be optimized for column-major memory access pattern, and have better parallelism if the number of columns is larger than the number of rows.
