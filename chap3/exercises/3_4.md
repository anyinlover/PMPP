> Consider a 2D matrix with a width of 400 and a height of 500. The matrix is stored as a one-dimensional array. Specify the array index of the matrix element at row 20 and column 10:

> a. If the matrix is stored in row-major order.

$ 20 * 400 + 10 = 8010 $

> b. If the matrix is stored in column-major order.

$ 10 * 500 + 20 = 5020 $
