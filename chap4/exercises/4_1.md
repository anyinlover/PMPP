> Consider the following CUDA kernel and the corresponding host function that calls it:

```c++
01  __global__ void foo_kernel(int* a, int* b) {
02      unsigned int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
03      if(threadIdx.x < 40 || threadIdx.x >= 104) {
04          b[i] = a[i] + 1;
05      }
06      if(i % 2 == 0) {
07          a[i] = b[i] * 2;
08      }
09      for(unsigned int j = 0; j < 5 - (i % 3); ++j) {
10          b[i] += j;
11      }
12  }
13  void foo(int* a_d, int* b_d) {
14      unsigned int N = 1024;
15      foo_kernel <<< (N + 128 - 1) / 128, 128 >>> (a_d, b_d);
16  }
```

> a. What is the number of warps per block?

$ 128 / 32 = 4 $

> b. What is the number of warps in the grid?

$ 8 * 4 = 32 $

> c. For the statement on line 04:

> i. How many warps in the grid are active?

$ 8 * 3 = 24 $

> ii. How many warps in the grid are divergent?

$ 8 * 2 = 16 $

> iii. What is the SIMD efficiency (in %) of warp 0 of block 0?

100%

> iv. What is the SIMD efficiency (in %) of warp 1 of block 0?

$ (40 - 32) / 32 = 25\% $

> v. What is the SIMD efficiency (in %) of warp 3 of block 0?

$ (128 - 104) / 32 = 75\% $

d. For the statement on line 07:

> i. How many warps in the grid are active?

32

> ii. How many warps in the grid are divergent?

32

> iii. What is the SIMD efficiency (in %) of warp 0 of block 0?

50%

e. For the loop on line 09:

> i. How many iterations have no divergence?

3

> ii. How many iterations have divergence?

2
