> A student mentions that they were able to multiply two $ 1024 * 1024 $ matrices using a matrix multiplication kernel with $ 32 * 32 $ thread blocks. The student is using a CUDA device that allows up to 512 threads per block and up to 8 blocks per SM. The student further mentions that each thread in a thread block calculates one element of the result matrix. What would be your reaction and why?

$ 1024 * 1024 / (32 * 32) = 1024 > 512 $

It can't be possible.
