> Consider a hypothetical block with 8 threads executing a section of code before reaching a barrier. The threads require the following amount of time (in microseconds) to execute the sections: 2.0, 2.3, 3.0, 2.8, 2.4, 1.9, 2.6, and 2.9; they spend the rest of their time waiting for the barrier. What percentage of the threadsâ€™ total execution time is spent waiting for the barrier?

$ (3.0 * 8 - (2.0 + 2.3 + 3.0 + 2.8 + 2.4 + 1.9 + 2.6 + 2.9)) / (3.0 * 8) = 17\% $
