> Assume a device that allows up to 64 blocks per SM and 2048 threads per SM. Indicate which of the following assignments per SM are possible. In the cases in which it is possible, indicate the occupancy level.

> a. 8 blocks with 128 threads each

> b. 16 blocks with 64 threads each

> c. 32 blocks with 32 threads each

> d. 64 blocks with 32 threads each

> e. 32 blocks with 64 threads each

a possible $ 8 * 128 / 2048 = 50\% $

b possible $ 16 * 64 / 2048 = 50\% $

c possible $ 32 * 32 / 2048 = 50\% $

d possible $ 64 * 32 / 2048 = 100\% $

e possible $ 32 * 64 / 2048 = 100\% $
