> We want to use each thread to calculate two elements of a vector addition. Each thread block processes `2*blockDim.x` consecutive elements that form two sections. All threads in each block will process a section first, each processing one element. They will then all move to the next section, each processing one element. Assume that variable i should be the index for the first element to be processed by a thread. What would be the expression for mapping the thread/block indices to data index of the first element?
