> Assume that we want to use each thread to calculate two adjacent elements of a vector addition. What would be the expression for mapping the thread/block indices to the data index (i) of the first element to be processed by a thread?

> (A) `i=blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x + 2`;

> (B) `i=blockIdx.x * threadIdx.x * 2`;

> (C) `i=(blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x) * 2`;

> (D) `i=blockIdx.x * blockDim.x 2 + threadIdx.x`;

C
